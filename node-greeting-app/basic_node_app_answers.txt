1. What is a Node module?

   A: A set of functions to include in your applications - similar to JavaScript libraries.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

   A:  `module.exports` can be reassigned to anything but `exports` is just a reference to `module.exports`.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

   A: Because `exports` is a reference to `module.exports` and cannot reassign the object `module.exports`,
      `exports` never returns so working with its properties is safe.
